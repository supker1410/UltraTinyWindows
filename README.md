# UltraTinyWindows
Trying to make windows run on every computer.
Im not a professional programmer or anything so please dont roast me if my code is unoptimized.
Im from Turkey so my english might not be great but im trying to improve it.
I started this in 2024 and at the time i didnt have enough c++ knowledge to continue this project so i decided to take a break and now i know c++ better so im continuing this project.
The first reason i wanted to make this is because of microsofts unreasonable system requirements.
The second reason is i have od computers and they are above windows 10 system requirements but because of windows update windows defender and other bloat it runs very poorly.
# How to install
We dont currently have the other windows files and installer ready but we hope we can get a working os with installer until the end of this year.
Currently we are working on windows files but all of the apps that we published are working.
If you know a optimization or improvement for any program you can make a discussion and we will look at it.
